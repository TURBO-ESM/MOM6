# Generate C++ bridge for a MOM6 Fortran subroutine

This skill is the **execution checklist**; templates, rationale, and
pitfalls live in `cpp_bridge_lessons` (§1–§17) — invoke it once per
session before running this skill, and refer back to its sections from
each step below (Step 0 checks it's loaded). Do not reproduce templates
here.

**Precondition:** the target's array dummies are already
`type(RealArray_t)`/`type(IntArray_t)`, its iteration domain already a
`type(Box_t)` — that's `convert_array_containers`'s job, run first;
Step 0 stops if it isn't done. The two skills are orthogonal:

| Owned by `convert_array_containers` | Owned by this skill |
|---|---|
| Array dummies → containers | The `*_fortran` rename |
| `%view` pointers in the body | The dispatcher shim + `select case (mode)` |
| Loops → `do concurrent` over a `Box_t` | `getenv_mode` and the env-var contract |
| Introducing a `Box_t` dummy | Capture mode / `io_recorder` |
| Call-site `alloc` / `copy2F` / `free` | `#ifdef _TIM` AMReX arm, `%to_c` |
| | The `bind(C)` interface declaration |
| | Halo-check and cpu-clock relocation |

Never do left-column work here — stop and refer the user to
`convert_array_containers` if the target needs it.

## Help message

If `$ARGUMENTS` is empty, or equals `help`, or equals `--help`, or equals
`-h`, do NOT run any steps. Print the following help message verbatim
and stop:

```
Usage: /generate_cpp_bridge <work-directory> <function-name> [--enable_src_validate] [--enable_git_commit] [--disable_git_commit]

Wrap a MOM6 Fortran subroutine in a runtime-dispatched shim that selects
between the original Fortran code, a capture mode for offline validation,
and a C++/AMReX bridge. Mirrors TURBO-ESM/MOM6 PR #15.

PRECONDITION: the target subroutine's array dummies must ALREADY be
RealArray_t / IntArray_t containers, with a Box_t iteration domain. If it
still takes raw arrays (real, dimension(SZI_(G),...)), run
/convert_array_containers on it first -- this skill does not convert data
structures.

Arguments:
  <work-directory>   Absolute path to an existing TURBO-ESM/MOM6 checkout
                     (must contain src/ and config_src/, and should be on
                     the dev/turbo-debug branch). Cloning is not performed.
  <function-name>    Name of the Fortran subroutine to wrap (case-insensitive
                     match against its declaration in the tree). Must
                     already be container-based.
  --enable_src_validate  (optional) Run Step 1: verify the work directory is a
                         TURBO-ESM/MOM6 checkout on dev/turbo-debug and that
                         the subroutine exists. Off by default.
  --enable_git_commit    (optional) Force Step 10 to run this invocation
                         only, overriding the global git_commit_and_push
                         preference in ~/.claude/preferences.json.
                         Mutually exclusive with --disable_git_commit.
  --disable_git_commit   (optional) Force Step 10 to be skipped this
                         invocation only, overriding the global
                         preference. Mutually exclusive with
                         --enable_git_commit.

When neither --enable_git_commit nor --disable_git_commit is passed, Step 10
follows ~/.claude/preferences.json's "git_commit_and_push" key ("auto" or
"manual"; treated as "manual" when the file is missing, the key is absent,
or the JSON fails to parse).

Example:
  /generate_cpp_bridge /glade/derecho/scratch/sunjian/MOM6 PPM_limit_pos
```

## Step 0 — validate inputs

`$0` = work-directory, `$1` = function-name. Run these checks **before any
other step** and stop on the first failure with a one-line, actionable
error. Do not retry, do not assume defaults, do not create anything.

1. **Argument count.** If `$0` empty OR `$1` empty → stop:
   `Error: missing arguments. Run "/generate_cpp_bridge --help" for usage.`
2. **Work directory is an existing MOM6 checkout.** If `$0` is not an
   existing directory → stop:
   `Error: work directory "<value>" does not exist.`
   Cloning is not performed by this skill; Step 1 verifies checkout
   identity and branch state.
3. **Parse optional flags.** Scan remaining arguments for `--enable_src_validate`,
   `--enable_git_commit`, and `--disable_git_commit`.
   Store as boolean flags (default: off). If both `--enable_git_commit` and
   `--disable_git_commit` are passed → stop: `Error: --enable_git_commit and
   --disable_git_commit are mutually exclusive.` Any unrecognised argument
   that starts with `--` → stop:
   `Error: unknown option "<value>". Run "/generate_cpp_bridge --help" for usage.`
4. **Reference material primed.** This skill assumes `cpp_bridge_lessons`
   has already been invoked earlier in this session. If you have no
   memory of its numbered sections (§3.1, §3.2, §5, §12, §13, §14, §15,
   §16, §17 are referenced throughout), invoke it now, before Step 1 or
   any step below — never guess at template content from memory.
5. **Target is already container-based.** Every grid-shaped array dummy
   must already be `type(RealArray_t)`/`type(IntArray_t)`, and the
   iteration domain already a `type(Box_t)`. If any dummy is still a raw
   grid-shaped array →
   stop:
   `Error: "<function-name>" still takes raw arrays. Run "/convert_array_containers <work-directory> <function-name>" first, then re-run this skill.`
   Do not convert them yourself (boundary table above) — that would
   duplicate `convert_array_containers`'s work and produce an
   unreviewable combined diff.

Step 1 runs only when `--enable_src_validate` is set. Items 4 and 5
always run, regardless of flags. Step 10's behavior is decided by
`--enable_git_commit`/`--disable_git_commit` if passed, or otherwise by
the global preference described in Step 10. No wrapping work executes
until Step 0 passes.

## Settle these decisions (ask if not obvious from the tree)

1. **Bridge prefix** — default to whatever existing `_bridge) bind(C)`
   declarations in the tree use; otherwise `turbotmp_`.
2. **Env-var name** — default `<UPPERCASE_$1>_MODE`.
3. **AMReX gating** — default `#ifdef _TIM` around the `case (TIMH_runAMREX)`
   arm only; capture mode is never gated.

The shim's public argument list is **not** a decision: it is inherited
verbatim from the converted subroutine (containers in, containers out),
so existing call sites need no changes.

If the user already specified any of these, take their values as-is.

## Procedure

Each step is one action with a pointer to the lessons.md section that
holds the template or rationale.

### 1. Validate the existing checkout *(runs only when `--enable_src_validate` is passed; skip otherwise and proceed to Step 2)*
   All wrapping work in this skill is based on the `dev/turbo-debug`
   branch — the agreed base for bridge work and what the C++ side
   expects to merge against.

   Verify `$0` is a TURBO-ESM/MOM6 checkout by running
   `git -C $0 remote -v` and confirming the output contains
   `TURBO-ESM/MOM6`. If not → stop:
   `Error: "<value>" is not a TURBO-ESM/MOM6 checkout.`

   Then run `git -C $0 fetch origin dev/turbo-debug` and check the
   branch state:
   - If the working tree is dirty (`git -C $0 status --porcelain` is
     non-empty) → stop and surface to the user; do not stash or discard.
   - If HEAD is not already at `origin/dev/turbo-debug` (compare
     `git -C $0 rev-parse HEAD` and
     `git -C $0 rev-parse origin/dev/turbo-debug`) → stop and ask the
     user whether to `git checkout dev/turbo-debug` before continuing.
     Do not switch branches silently — the user may have unrelated work
     on the current branch.

   **Then validate the tree** before proceeding to Step 2 — stop on the
   first failure with a one-line, actionable error:
   - **Looks like MOM6.** If `$0/src` or `$0/config_src` is missing → stop:
     `Error: "<value>" is not a MOM6 source tree (missing src/ or config_src/).`
   - **Subroutine present.** Run `grep -irn "^[[:space:]]*subroutine[[:space:]]\+<function-name>\b" $0/src $0/config_src`.
     - 0 matches → stop: `Error: subroutine "<function-name>" not found under <work-directory>/{src,config_src}.`
     - >1 match → list candidates and ask the user which file to wrap.
   - **`lessons.md` present.** If `$0/.claude/skills/generate_cpp_bridge/lessons.md` is missing → stop:
     `Error: lessons.md not found at <work-directory>/.claude/skills/generate_cpp_bridge/lessons.md.`
     This is an **existence check only** — a cheap proxy for "this
     checkout has the skill installed." Do not read it for guidance:
     content moved to `cpp_bridge_lessons`, and an older checkout's copy
     may be stale (e.g. still showing the removed `%dup` API). Always
     take templates and API detail from `cpp_bridge_lessons`.
   - **Confirm the plan.** Print one paragraph naming: the resolved
     subroutine file path, the proposed env-var (`<UPPERCASE_$1>_MODE`),
     the proposed bridge symbol (`<prefix>_$1_bridge`; pick `<prefix>` by
     `grep -h "_bridge) bind(C)" $0/src $0/config_src` — fall back to
     `turbotmp_`), and the caller files found by
     `grep -irl "call[[:space:]]\+<function-name>(" $0/src $0/config_src`.
     Then proceed to Step 2.

### 2. Classify each dummy argument for the C boundary
   The dummies are already containers (Step 0 item 5). For every arg,
   record intent/kind/rank/optional, and map it to its `bind(C)`
   counterpart using lessons.md §3.1–§3.2: `type(RealArray_t)` →
   `type(RealArray_C)`, `type(Box_t)` → `type(Box_C)`, scalars →
   `real(c_double)`/`integer(c_int)`/`logical(c_bool)` by value,
   pointers → `type(c_ptr)`.

   Do **not** introduce a `Box_t`, and do not alter any dummy's type. If
   the iteration domain is not already a `Box_t`, stop and refer the
   user to `convert_array_containers` — Step 0 item 5 should have
   caught this.

### 3. Rename the original implementation
   Rename `$1` → `$1_fortran` in place. **That is the only change to
   this subroutine.** Body, dummy declarations, `%view` calls, and loop
   structure are already container-based and must be left byte-for-byte
   unchanged apart from the `subroutine`/`end subroutine` name lines.
   Template: lessons.md §12.

   Do not convert array dummies (already done), rewrite loops (already
   `do concurrent` over the `Box_t`), or touch the math.

### 4. Add the `bind(C)` interface block
   At the top of the host module, declare `<prefix>_$1_bridge` per the
   template in lessons.md §3.3. Doc-comment every dummy with `!<`.

### 5. Write the shim subroutine `$1`
   Takes the public name the original had, and **inherits that
   subroutine's container-based dummy list verbatim** — same names,
   types, intents, `!<` comments. Because the signature is unchanged,
   existing call sites keep working untouched.

   No array↔container wrapping happens anywhere in this shim: the
   containers arrive ready to use. Each dispatch arm either passes them
   straight to `$1_fortran` or converts them to their `_C` mirrors with
   `%to_c()` for the bridge call (inside `#ifdef _TIM` — lessons.md §9
   on why `%to_c` cannot appear unguarded).

   Body is one `select case (mode)` over
   `getenv_mode("<ENV_VAR>", default=TIMH_runFORTRAN)` with three arms:
   `TIMH_capture`, `TIMH_runAMREX` (inside `#ifdef _TIM`), and `case
   default` falling through to `$1_fortran`. Template: lessons.md §2.
   Capture-record naming: lessons.md §13.

### 6. Update host-module `use` statements
   Add the imports listed in lessons.md §14, deduplicating with what the
   module already has.

### 7. Confirm callers need no changes
   The shim's signature is identical to the pre-rename subroutine's
   (Step 5), so every existing call site remains valid by construction.
   Verify this rather than assuming: run
   `grep -rn "call[[:space:]]\+$1(" $0/src $0/config_src` and confirm each
   site's argument count and order still match. Do not edit any call site.

   If a call site *does* need changing, something has gone wrong — most
   likely the shim's signature drifted from the original in Step 5. Stop
   and fix the shim instead of rewriting callers.

   Any call-site work involving `alloc`/`copy2F`/`free` belongs to
   `convert_array_containers`, not here.

### 8. Relocate halo checks and CPU clocks
   Move any halo-sufficiency `MOM_error(FATAL,...)` from inside the
   kernel to the caller or the shim entry (lessons.md §15). Leave any
   pre-existing `cpu_clock_begin/end` at the caller, around the shim
   call — never inside the shim (lessons.md §16).

### 9. Verify
   Run the three-mode matrix in lessons.md §17. If only the Fortran
   shim + capture are being delivered, stop after CAPTURE verification
   and report that the C++ side of `<prefix>_$1_bridge` is the next
   deliverable.

### 10. Commit and push to `claude_<function-name>_bridge` *(gated by the global git-commit preference, overridable per run — see below)*
   **Decide whether to run this step:**
   1. If `--disable_git_commit` was passed, skip this entire step and
      report the files that were modified so the user can commit
      manually — this run's explicit override wins.
   2. Else if `--enable_git_commit` was passed, run this step — this
      run's explicit override wins.
   3. Else, read the global preference: run
      `cat ~/.claude/preferences.json 2>/dev/null` and inspect the
      `git_commit_and_push` key.
      - If it is `"auto"`, run this step.
      - If it is `"manual"`, or the file does not exist, or the key is
        absent, or the JSON fails to parse — skip this entire step and
        report the files that were modified so the user can commit
        manually. Absent or unreadable configuration means "manual";
        never push on an unconfigured machine.

   From the work directory, create (or check out, if it already exists)
   the branch `claude_$1_bridge` (use the lowercased function name so
   different functions land on different branches and can be committed
   in parallel). Step 1 has already guaranteed HEAD is at
   `dev/turbo-debug`, so the new branch will be based on it. Stage every
   modified and newly created file, and commit with a message that
   briefly summarizes the changes (the wrapped subroutine name, the new
   bridge symbol, and the affected caller files) and explicitly notes
   that the work is co-authored by Claude. Use a HEREDOC so the trailer
   is preserved verbatim:

   ```
   BRANCH="claude_$(echo "$1" | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]')_bridge"
   git checkout -B "$BRANCH"
   git add -A
   git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
   <one-line summary of the wrapping work for $1>

   <optional 1–3 line body describing the bridge symbol, callers touched,
   and verification mode reached>

   Co-authored-by: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>
   EOF
   )"
   git push -u origin "$BRANCH"
   ```

   If the push is rejected because the branch already exists upstream
   with unrelated history, stop and surface the conflict to the user
   rather than force-pushing.

## Versioning marker

Every Fortran file this skill creates or modifies gets a `!!SKILLS: 0.3`
marker line — the shared version number for this whole skill family,
not just this one skill. If the file doesn't already have one, add it
as its own line immediately after the license/header comment block,
before the `module` statement; if it already has one, update it rather
than adding a second line. Deliberately grep-able
(`grep -rn "!!SKILLS:"`) and meant to be stripped later.

## Hard rules

- Never skip the `!!SKILLS: 0.3` marker on a file this skill touches,
  and never add a second marker line if one already exists.
- Do not change the public name of `$1`, or its argument list at all —
  the shim inherits the converted subroutine's container signature
  verbatim and must drop into existing call sites unchanged.
- Do not do `convert_array_containers`'s work (boundary table above) —
  never change a dummy's type, introduce a `Box_t`, rewrite a loop
  nest, or add `alloc`/`%view`/`copy2F`/`free` at a call site.
- Do not introduce a global mode variable; per-kernel env vars only.
- Do not gate capture mode behind `#ifdef _TIM`; only the AMReX arm is gated.
- Do not omit the `case default` arm.
- Do not pass default-kind `logical`/`integer` to a `bind(C)` routine —
  cast to `c_bool`/`c_int` (lessons.md §3.2).
- Do not call `c_loc(this%data(1))` on an unallocated container; allocate
  first.
- Do not re-implement `getenv_mode`, `already_recorded`, `mark_recorded`,
  or `io_recorder` — `use` them from `turbotmp_helperF`.
- Do not reuse a `kernel` string across kernels.

If something not covered here comes up, consult lessons.md §10
(recurring pitfalls) before improvising.
